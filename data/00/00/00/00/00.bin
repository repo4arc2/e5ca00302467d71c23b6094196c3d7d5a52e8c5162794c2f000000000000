它们不仅仅是线性的
It's more than a linear path.

00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,680
而是一个拥有无限可能的棱镜
It's a prism of endless possibility,

14
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,640
一个选择便能开辟出无数个现实
where a single choice can branch out into infinite realities,

15
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,070

25
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,920
太好了  一次就进了  简  你欠我50块
Yes! First try. Jane, you owe me 50--

26
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,080
简  简  简
Uh, Jane, Jane, Jane!

27
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,940
它在哔哔响  它哔哔响
It's beeping! It's doing the beeping!

28
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,450
我要与神盾局局长通话
I need to talk to the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

29
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,880
因为如果我的数据正确
Because, if my data is correct,

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,050
那么应该就会马上发生外星人入侵
I believe an alien invasion is imminent and...

31
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,040
喂
Hello?

32
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,060
两年前  伊卡洛斯阿尔法星出现了同样的反常现象
Two years ago, the same anomaly struck Star Alpha Icarus

33
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,640
然后整个星体变暗  噗得一下瓦解了
and the entire star dimmed and then, poof, disintegrated.

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,630
是  我知道你们是公园管理局
Yes, I know this is the Parks Department,

35
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,470
但你们就不能做点什么吗
but isn't there something you can do?

36
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,020
这可是世界末日级别的事件  兄弟
Talking about the end of the world, my dude.

37
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,790
他们来了
They're here.

38
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,340
太迟了  入侵已经开始了
We're too late. The invasion has begun.

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,870
{\an8}欢迎来到拉斯维加斯

40
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,240
天啊
Holy moly!

41
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,080
米德加德的子民们
Citizens of Midgard...

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,690
你们无聊的生活即将结束
...your dull lives are about to come to an end.

43
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,090
准备好
Prepare yourselves...

44
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,140
迎接派对王子吧
for the party prince!

45
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,320
会很棒的
This is gonna be awesome.

46
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,740
比起战争输赢
More than battles won or lost,

47
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,620
真正定义英雄的其实是关系
it's relationships that truly define a hero.

48
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,300
塑造他们的人  他们的经历
The people who shape them, their stories.

49
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,550
托尔和洛基  浓烈而举足轻重的兄弟情
Thor and Loki, a brotherhood so strong and pivotal,

50
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,850
可以改变一个宇宙的命运
it would change the fate of a universe.

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,590
托尔从他们的童年吸取了很多教训
Their childhood taught Thor many lessons.

52
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,770
但在另一个宇宙
But in another universe,

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,990
奥丁没有把约顿海姆的王子洛基当成亲儿子抚养
instead of raising the Jotunheim prince, Loki, as his own son,

54
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,280
而是将他还给了他的子民
Odin returned him to his people.

55
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,290
没有了他那爱耍诡计的弟弟捣乱
Without his trickster brother to keep things, let's say, lively,

56
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,620
托尔长成了一个迥然不同的王子
Thor grew into a very different prince.

57
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,900
休息吧  亲爱的
Rest, my love.

58
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,580
让奥丁之眠恢复和治愈你的身体
Allow the Odinsleep to restore your body and soul.

59
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,410
他睡着了  那么...
He's asleep. And, uh...

60
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,930
我要去姐妹家庆祝夏至了
I'm off to my sister's to celebrate the solstice.

61
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,180
这是你第一次品尝做国王的滋味  王子
Now, this is your first taste of kinghood, my prince.

62
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,430
我希望你学习
I expect you to study,

63
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,060
读读你终有一天要统治的九大王国
read up on the Nine Realms that you will one day rule.

64
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,320
当然  母后
Of course, Mother.

65
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,290
-不许办派对  -当然  母亲
- No parties. - Of course, Mother.

66
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,670
别忘了海姆达尔会盯着你的
Remember, Heimdall will be watching.

67
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,440
等等  什么  你不是认真的吧
Wait, what? You can't be serious.

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,490
听话
Behave.

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,030
海姆达尔  你在这儿啊
Oh, Heimdall, there you are.

70
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,970
我这就去学习  书不读不进脑子
Just off to study. Books won't read themselves.

71
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,090
但您的母后说
But your mother said--

72
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,620
别这么扫兴嘛  霍根
Don't be such a wet blanket, Hogun.

73
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,770
朋友们别说了  父王统治阿斯加德已经好几个世纪
Oh, guys, stop. My father has ruled Asgard for centuries.

74
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,060
看啊  他做过的最有趣的事
And, look, the most interesting thing

75
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,730
只是睡着
that he's ever done is fall asleep.

76
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,520
他只在乎责任职责什么的
He only cares about duty and blah-blah-blah-blah responsibility.

77
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,990
我可不要变得像他一样  无趣的国王  不
Well, I'm not gonna be like him, right? The boring king? Uh-uh.

78
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,030
但海姆达尔都看在眼里
But Heimdall sees all.

79
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,970
我们一有动作他就会告诉弗丽嘉
If we try anything, he'll call Frigga.

80
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,450
有点信心嘛
Oh, ye of little faith.

81
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,650
我们要去连海姆达尔都不会注意到的
We are going to the most backward, backwater planet

82
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,080
最落后  最与世隔绝的星球
that not even Heimdall pays attention to.

83
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,340
提醒各王国
Alert the realms.

84
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,680
在米德加德办派对
Party on Midgard!

85
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,240
{\an8}欢迎来到拉斯维加斯

86
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,580
太好了
Yes!

87
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,970
呜呼
Huzzah!

88
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,310
敬派对王子托尔
To Thor, the party prince!

89
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,150
-欢迎  欢迎朋友们  -派对王子
- Welcome! Welcome, friends. - Party prince!

90
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,420
享受今夜
Enjoy the night.

91
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,810
雷电抱抱
Thunder hug.

92
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,330
来  喝一杯  酒永远喝不完
Here, have a drink. It never runs out.

93
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,550
你想喝完
You try to drink it all,

94
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,600
但你喝不完  因为这是魔法  呜呼
but you can't because it's magic! Huzzah!

95
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,230
呜呼  托尔  托尔  托尔
Huzzah! Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor! Thor!

96
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,940
那么多好莱坞电影可没告诉我会有这一幕
Hollywood movies did not prepare me for this.

97
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,430
不是应该有更多激光吗  探测器  会飞的奶牛
Shouldn't there be more lasers? Probing? A flying cow?

98
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,390
我的数据显示
According to my data,

99
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,090
第一个到来的外星生物是
the first extraterrestrial to arrive was...

100
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,880
他
Him?

101
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,440
我本以为他会更像...
I expected him to look more like...

102
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,740
更像什么  ET
Like what? E.T.?

103
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,140
不这么像热辣帅哥  海滩上的芭比娃娃男友
And less like a hottie McScotty, beach body Ken,

104
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,770
老派的A&F新品目录男模  我还能继续举例
old-school Abercrombie catalog? I could go on. Let me.

105
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,960
我要跟他谈谈
I'm gonna go talk to him.

106
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,780
我要跟外星人首次接触
I'm gonna make first contact with an alien.

107
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,270
还首次  半条街的人都比你早吧
First? I think half the Strip beat you to it.

108
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,840
你可以跟...
You can make first contact with...

109
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,490
我说不好  那人进行首次接触  他看着像个窝囊废
I don't know, that guy. He looks like a loser.

110
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,760
黑发小妞口出狂言
Big talk coming from a brunette.

111
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,630
我这就去  我看起来怎么样
I'm going. How do I look?

112
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,370
对接下来发生的事毫无准备
Completely unprepared for whatever happens next.

113
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,050
变成我  变成我
Oh, do me, do me.

114
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,420
你变成我  变成我  你也是
Yes, you do me. You do me, and you too.

115
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,660
你们真像我  怎么了
Oh, you guys really get me. Yes?

116
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,130
你在这儿啊  站在这里
Oh, there you are, all the way down there.

117
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,710
好小  我差点踩到你  你好吗
So tiny, I almost stood on you. How are you?

118
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,300
我是地球的简·福斯特博士
I'm Dr. Jane Foster of Earth.

119
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,540
我是阿斯加德王子托尔
Yeah, Thor, Crown Prince of Asgard.

120
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,350
酒  生菜沙拉  点心  你要吗
Uh, libations, crudités, baked goods?

121
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,310
托佩兹  我总说什么来着
Topaz, what do I always say?

122
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,320
我爱蛋糕
I love cake.

123
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,520
等等  你是托尔
Wait, wait, wait. You're Thor?

124
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:10,520
那个挪威雷神托尔
As in Thor, the Norse god of thunder?

125
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,520
我不知道什么马神
I don't know anything about horse gods,

126
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,080
但我知道怎么召唤雷电[炒热气氛]but I do know how to bring the thunder.

127
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,420
好吧  我继续
Okay, moving on.

128
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,530
18个月以前  伊卡洛斯阿尔法星死亡
Eighteen months ago, Alpha Star Icarus died.

129
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,330
它消失前出现的天文现象
The astronomaly that preceded it...

130
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,310
-今晚又出现了  -别喝太多了
- ...happened again tonight. - Don't drink too much.

131
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,000
-也别喝太少  -雷电小子
- Or too little. - Hey, thunder boy.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,510
我想问  这是你干的吗
What I'm asking is, was that you?

133
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,990
是  阿尔法星  那次派对可太棒了
Yes, Alpha Star. Now, that was an excellent party.

134
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,060
我们三天都没找到范达尔
You know, we lost Fandral for three days.

135
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,940
最后在一座谷仓里找到他  蜷缩在山羊宝宝旁边
Found him in a barn, curled up next to a baby goat.

136
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,150
可经典了  对不对  范达尔
It was classic. Isn't that right, Fandral?

137
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,680
我给它起名叫加里
I named him Gary.

138
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,420
-没错  -羊最赞啦
- Yeah, you did. - Yeah, goats!

139
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,800
你们杀死了一颗行星
You killed a planet.

140
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,280
你手里这发光盒子是什么东西
Oh, what is that light box thing you've got there?

141
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,290
是魔法  我好爱魔法  是你一个人造的吗
Oh, it's magic. I love magic. Did you build this all by yourself?

142
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,060
不好意思  我刚好是有多个博士学位的天体物理学家
Excuse me? I happen to be an astrophysicist with multiple PhDs.

143
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,220
得要一大帮阿斯加德人
You know, it would take a whole team of Asgardians 

144
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,540
才能造出这种东西
to create such a thing.

145
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,870
你一定是天才  你是天才吧
You must be a genius. You are a genius, aren't you?

146
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,490
我不确定是不是天才啦  不过...
Well, I don't know about genius, but...

147
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,790
还有  你的眼睛
And your eyes...

148
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:07,500
所有天才的眼睛都是如此神秘幽深吗
Do all geniuses have such deep, dark eyes?

149
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,640
就像看着两颗星星
It's like watching the birth

150
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,880
在银河系边缘诞生
of two stars on the edge of the galaxy.

151
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,280
现在是特价时段  想来点半价玉米片吗
Well, it's happy hour. Want some half-price nachos?

152
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,220
好吧  鸭仔  但这可不是约会
Okay, fine, Duck. But this is not a date.

153
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,790
看看会怎么发展呗
Let's just see where this evolves.

154
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,170
放泡沫
Release the foam.

155
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,750
对骰子吹气
Blow on these.

156
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,970
老娘需要新视角
Momma needs a brand-new eye.

157
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,980
沃斯塔格坠机啦
Volstagg has crashed!

158
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,510
我现在宣布你们结为达西和怪鸭夫妻
I now pronounce you Darcy and the Duck.

159
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,310
{\an8}好开始纹身店

160
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,100
{\an8}魔法  科学

161
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,100
电话
Ah, phone.

162
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,810
电话  电话  别吵了
Ah, phone... Phone! Oh, shut up!

163
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,000
{\an8}未知来电

164
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,520
简·福斯特博士
Dr. Jane Foster?

165
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,010
来了  来了
Coming. I'm coming.

166
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,830
简·福斯特博士
Dr. Jane Foster!

167
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,450
等一下
Hold on.

168
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,700
简·福斯特博士  我们是神盾局
Dr. Jane Foster, this is S.H.I.E.L.D.

169
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,320
如果你不开门  我们就...
If you do not answer, we will--

170
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,310
什么事
Yes?

171
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,820
我们找到她了  长官
We have her, ma'am.

172
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,960
我是玛丽亚·希尔  神盾局代理局长
Maria Hill, Acting Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

173
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,180
你得跟我们走
You need to come with us.

174
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,270
能不能等我先吃完早餐
Can this wait until after breakfast? 'Cause...

175
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,400
你是第一个警告我们有外星威胁的人
You were the first to warn us about this extraterrestrial threat.

176
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,740
现在我希望你会是消除威胁的关键人物
Now I hope you will be the key to eliminating it.

177
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,740
"威胁"  你真觉得他是威胁吗
"Threat"? Would you call him a threat, really?

178
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,030
你想知道我为什么是代理局长吗  福斯特博士
Do you wanna know why I am the Acting Director, Dr. Foster?

179
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,190
不行
Nope.

180
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,170
大玩咖  这虽然是你的派对
Hey, Spicoli. This might be your party,

181
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,790
但这里不是你的星球
but this isn't your planet.

182
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,860
在有人受伤之前  我需要...
Before someone gets hurt, I need...

183
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,040
深水炸弹
Ball cannons!

184
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,640
-他没事吧  -仍然昏迷不醒
- Is he okay? - He's still unconscious.

185
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,150
要不要点吃的
We getting food?

186
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,870
屋里还有别人吗  福斯特博士
Do you have company, Dr. Foster?

187
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,600
是一个朋友
Uh... A friend.

188
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,340
你们快看  洗手池里有只可爱的小兔子
Guys, guys, look. There's a cute little rabbit in the sink.

189
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,850
瞧这小兔子  多漂亮啊
Oh, look at this little rabbit. It's gorgeous.

190
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,290
他是...动物学家  我再联系你  好吗
He's... a zoologist. I'll call you, okay?

191
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,410
我全都告诉你了
I told you everything.

192
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,730
我追踪异常的起源  到了拉斯维加斯
I followed the anomaly's origin to Vegas.

193
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,240
然后你做了什么
And then what did you do?

194
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,080
局长  派对气氛似乎蔓延开来了
Director, the party atmosphere seems to be spreading.

195
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,100
加拿大  蒙古  甚至是宾州荷兰郡
Canada, Mongolia, even Pennsylvania Dutch country.

196
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,270
由主要煽动者  阿斯加德的托尔领头
Led by the main instigator, Thor of Asgard,

197
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,950
他现在已经飞走了
who's now taken to the skies.

198
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,210
什么  他走了
What? He left?

199
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,910
他...他有没有留下字条
Did he... Did he even leave a note at...

200
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,770
我是说  他有没有说他去哪儿了
I mean, did... Did he say where he was going?

201
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,710
-转得真"不硬"  -多谢了
- Smooth. - Thanks.

202
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,270
-我是讽刺你  -巴黎
- Sarcasm. - Paris.

203
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,410
他一个同伙的原话是  "馋可丽饼了"
One of his compatriots was, and I quote, "Jonesing for crepes."

204
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,320
长官
Ma'am...

205
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,730
最后手段到了
the last resort has arrived.

206
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,560
等一下  "最后手段"  听起来没转弯余地了
Whoa, whoa. "Last resort" sounds very final.

207
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,460
这可是地球第一次接触到外星生命
This is Earth's first encounter with alien life.

208
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,150
今天的应对方式将为我们和外星的外交关系
How we respond today will set the tone for diplomatic relations

209
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,560
定下好几代的基调
between our worlds for generations.

210
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,930
"外交关系"
"Diplomatic relations"?

211
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,730
现在的年轻人都用这种词吗
Is that what the kids are calling it?

212
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,880
你错了  博士
You're wrong, Doctor.

213
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,830
这不是神盾局第一次遭遇外星人
This isn't S.H.I.E.L.D.'s first alien rodeo.

214
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,540
传呼机  我爸有一部  他是足病医生
A beeper? My dad has one! He's a podiatrist.

215
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,830
等等  你们要呼叫足病医生吗
Wait, are you guys calling a podiatrist?

216
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,300
{\an8}发送中

217
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,610
完成了
It's done.

218
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,430
正在发生吗  有发生吗  我错过什么了
Is it happening? Did it happen? What'd I miss?

219
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,670
好  来吧  都贴近一点
All right, here we go. Nestle on in.

220
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,740
-所有人说"华夫饼"  我喜欢这词  -茄子
- Everyone say "Waffles." I love that word. - Cheese.

221
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,020
上面浇了枫糖浆和鲜奶油的华夫饼
Waffles with maple syrup and whipped cream on top.

222
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:15,930
-托尔  -托尔
- Thor! - Thor!

223
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,570
他来了  他来了
He came! He's here!

224
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,270
女巫的那个混蛋儿子  托尔·奥丁森在哪
Oi! Where's that son of a witch, Thor Odinson?

225
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,580
你说什么
What did you say?

226
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:30,350
范达尔  那根丑爆的冰棍是在跟我说话吗
Fandral, tell me, is that butt-ugly popsicle stick talking to me?

227
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,690
-击个拳  -你居然来了
- Bring it on in. - I can't believe you came!

228
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,470
洛基  你真是最棒啦
Loki, you are the absolute best!

229
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,900
你就是我的异母兄弟  我真心这么认为
You're my brother from another mother, man. I mean that.

230
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,540
-真心的  -一辈子的好兄弟
- I mean it. - Brothers forever.

231
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,540
一辈子的好兄弟
Brothers forever!

232
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,670
一辈子
Forever!

233
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,450
等等  怎么有闷响  你是不是放屁了
Wait, what's that boom? Did you boom?

234
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:56,640
我没放屁  你有放吗  你经常放屁
No, I didn't boom. Did you boom? You always boom.

235
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,390
我从来不放  我只在私下放
I never boom. I only boom in private.

236
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:02,560
洛基  快看  是流星  赶紧许愿
Oh, oh, oh. Loki, look, it's a shooting star. Make a wish, quick!

237
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,490
对  是流星  好  我希望...
Yes, yes, a shooting star. Yes, okay. I wish... I wish...

238
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,890
{\an8}法国

239
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,690
我希望  我希望  我希望
I wish, I wish, I wish... I wish...

240
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,990
-我想到了  -什么愿望  告诉我
- Uh... I've got it! - What is it? Tell me.

241
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,980
我怎么能告诉你  说出来会不灵的
I couldn't possibly tell you. It'll ruin the magic.

242
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,040
白蛇  我们得谈谈
Hey, Whitesnake. We need to chat.

243
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,810
我叫托尔  写法是TROH
The name is Thor, with a "T" And an "R" and an "O" and a "H."

244
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,990
但不是按这个顺序
But not in that order.

245
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,650
-你办的派对不错  -根本是最精彩的
- Quite some party you're throwing. - Isn't it the best?

246
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,060
我本来希望冰霜兄弟们能来
I mean, I'd hoped the Ice Bros would show,

247
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,250
但洛基居然亲自驾到  洛基王子耶
but Loki himself? Prince Loki?

248
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,500
你开玩笑吗  我怎么可能错过
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for the world.

249
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,650
听着  收拾好这烂摊子  然后离开这星球
Listen, bud, clean up this mess and leave this planet.

250
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,170
什么  不要  我喜欢这里  人人都喜欢我
What? No, I like it here. Everyone likes me.

251
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,400
我们玩得超开心  直到你出现了
We're having a great time... till you showed up.

252
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,590
派对结束了  哥们
Party's over, pal.

253
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,250
是吗  我倒有个想法
Mmm. Yeah, maybe here's a thought.

254
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,130
不如你滚蛋吧
Uh, how about you just buzz off?

255
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,500
这不是请求  万人迷
I wasn't asking, hotshot.

256
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,880
米德加德有个词用来形容你这种女人
You know, there's a Midgardian word for women like you.

257
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,550
扫兴鬼
Party pooper.

258
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,380
没错  我就说了
There. I said it.

259
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,250
好吧  这一拳是替弗瑞出气
Okay, this one's for Fury.

260
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,880
剩下的人...
Now, for the rest of you...

261
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,530
吃我一锤
Have at you!

262
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,020
出手挺利落  但你...
Smooth move, bro. You just--

263
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,990
回旋锤  懂了吗
Hammerang. Get it?

264
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,240
听着  伙计  我数到三
Look, pal, I'm gonna count to three

265
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,880
你把锤子放下
and you're gonna put the hammer down.

266
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,410
来了  来了
Oh, here we go. Here we go.

267
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,510
和你说什么来着  停手
Hey, what did I tell you? Knock it off.

268
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:09,970
{\an8}英国

269
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,660
停下  这些都是...
Hey, quit it. These are...

270
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,890
我也不知道这些是什么
I don't know what these are.

271
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,030
没人知道  但是...不  我说不行  停
No one does. But... No! I said no! Stop.

272
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,400
但我只需要轻轻这么一下
Oh, but I just have to do a little boop.

273
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,080
完了  你的怪石头都倒了
Oh, no, your weird rocks have all fallen over.

274
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,750
派对出丑
Party foul.

275
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,770
马上就来  再等一秒
Be right with you. Just one second.

276
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,610
来了  开打
Ah, there it is. Whoo! Let's do this.

277
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,880
你猜怎么  我开始有点...
You know, I'm starting to...

278
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,060
不许揪头发
Ow! Not the hair!

279
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,400
你知道你需要什么吗
You know what you need?

280
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,990
一杯烈酒  外加夏威夷度假两周
A stiff drink and two weeks in Hawaii?

281
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,010
需要暂停
A time-out.

282
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,310
我妈经常用暂停来惩罚我
My mother punished me with time-outs all the time,

283
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,540
但对我从来没用
but I never learned a thing.

284
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,770
但也许对你有用  因为你是派对扫兴者
But maybe they'll work on you because you're a party pooper.

285
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,270
大家来看啊  这是个派对扫兴者
Hey, look, everyone! A party pooper.

286
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,710
扫兴者  扫兴者  扫兴者
Pooper! Pooper! Pooper!

287
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,270
弗瑞说你是最棒的
Fury said you were the best.

288
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,420
一拳能抵十颗核弹
That your punch was equal to ten nuclear bombs.

289
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,930
你的猫还能吞掉整支部队
That your cat could devour whole armies.

290
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,790
你还有只猫  它叫什么
You've got a cat? What's its name?

291
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,730
咕咕
Goose.

292
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,330
顶级飞行员  你可真特立独行
Oh, Top Gun! You're Maverick!

293
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,630
你的自尊是否太大但能力却跟不上
Is your ego writing checks that your skills can't cash?

294
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,640
-没有  -是的
- No. - Yes.

295
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,770
-你是哪位  -达西  你的大粉丝
- Who are you? - Darcy. Big fan.

296
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,440
顺便说句  本来以为你是个男队长
By the way, totally thought you were gonna be a dude captain.

297
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,790
但看看你  完全不是
But look at you, all not.

298
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,740
如果我使出全力  会在地球炸出一个大坑
If I exert my full powers, I blow a crater in this planet.

299
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,380
制服KK疯男并不值得冒这么大伤亡风险
Taking down Kappa Kappa frat freak won't be worth the fatalities.

300
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,020
那在南达科塔怎么样
Ooh. What about South Dakota?

301
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,770
或者北达科塔呢
Or North Dakota?

302
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,160
{\an8}未知来电

303
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,710
我要接个电话
Uh... I need to get this.

304
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,570
你需要实习生吗  驯猫人呢
So, uh, do you need an intern? Cat wrangler?

305
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,810
达西  现在你热情过于高涨
Darcy, right now, you're running at an eight,

306
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,700
我需要你稍微冷静一下  可以吗
and I need you to take it down to a four. Okay?

307
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,970
-喂  -简
- Hello? - Jane!

308
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,260
我什么时候可以再见到你
When can I see you again?

309
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,530
你是我遇到过的最善良最美丽的米德加德女人
You're the nicest, prettiest Midgardian woman I've ever met.

310
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,520
你遇到过多少个地球女人
How many Earth women have you met?

311
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,340
两个  但另一个用一座桥砸我
Uh, two. But the other one hit me with a bridge

312
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,120
然后  疼的可不只是脸
and, well, that hurt more than my face.

313
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,550
托尔  和我实言相告
Thor, be honest with me.

314
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,580
你在阿尔法星的最后一次派对上
At your last party on Alpha Star,

315
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,350
是真的毁掉了那颗星球吗
did you really destroy that planet?

316
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,200
没有  没  那也不是星球  最多就是颗流星
No, no, it was more of a meteor anyway, not a planet.

317
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,330
而且它也正在燃烧殆尽
And it was burning apart

318
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,370
所以我们也就帮着推了一下...
so we just kinda helped it along and...

319
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,750
所以并没人受伤害
So no one got hurt?

320
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,920
-当然没有  -福斯特博士
- Of course not. - Dr. Foster?

321
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,130
哪怕那只小山羊  加里  都安全回家
Even the baby goat, Gary, got home safely.

322
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,980
-最终回家了  -福斯特博士
- Eventually. - Dr. Foster.

323
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,410
我得走了  爱你
Uh, I gotta go. Love you. Oh.

324
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,450
我是想说  再见
I mean, bye.

325
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,500
我们之前在说什么来着
What were we talking about?

326
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,190
我想说的是
Look, all I'm saying is,

327
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,730
就算你炸飞一个达科塔  也没人会注意到
no one would notice if you blew up a Dakota.

328
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,250
说真的  我根本分不清它俩
Honestly, I can't tell them apart.

329
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,820
南达科塔在北达科塔下面
South Dakota is on the bottom.

330
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,180
这个主意不错
It's not a bad idea.

331
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,010
莫哈维沙漠可以承受那个程度的攻击
The Mojave Desert could withstand the hit.

332
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,890
把他引到西伯利亚  然后直接炸飞
Lure him to Siberia and then go kaboom on his ass.

333
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,950
你不是认真的吧  我们不会把他炸飞
You're not serious. We're not gonna kaboom him.

334
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,650
我们说的可是整个星球的命运
We're talking about the fate of the planet.

335
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,800
他是有点呆  没错
He's a lughead, sure,

336
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,890
也并不是最招人喜欢的那个
and far from the brightest crayon in the box.

337
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,400
但这个计划太过激进  我不会让它发生
But this plan is way over the top, and I refuse to let it happen.

338
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,610
谢谢你的专业指导  福斯特博士
Thank you for your expertise, Dr. Foster,

339
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,190
但我们已经不需要你的协助了
but your assistance is no longer required.

340
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,820
该死  我和银河女王蜂的实习计划也泡汤了
Damn! There goes my internship with the Galactic Queen Bee.

341
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,800
看是谁步履蹒跚的回来了  这不是鸭夫人吗
Well, look who came waddling back. Mrs. The Duck.

342
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,240
-现在不是吵架的时候  霍华德  -喂  托尔
- Not now, Howard! - Hello, Thor?

343
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,950
-你是谁  -我是简  你能听到吗
- Who's this? - It's Jane. Can you hear me?

344
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,430
稍等  是那女孩吗  托尔的新甜心  喂
Wait. Is this the girl? Thor's new sweet lady? Hello.

345
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,600
托尔在吗
Is Thor there?

346
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,320
午夜吃中餐最棒了  我爱食物
Late-night Chinese is the best. Oh, I love food.

347
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,980
洛基  你这个蓝家伙赶紧滚过来
Loki, get your blue butt over here.

348
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,410
一定要尝尝这些饺子
You have to try these dumplings.

349
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,450
地球女孩  你有朋友吗
Hey, Earth girl. You haven't got a friend, have you?

350
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,880
我们可以来个双人约会
You know, we could double date.

351
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,140
真恶心  你能赶快把手机给他吗
Ugh! Will you just put him on the phone?

352
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,960
不要因为点小事就不高兴  他就在...
Oh, don't get your knickers in a twist. He's right here... Oh!

353
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,290
完了
Oh. Right.

354
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,530
喂  洛基
Hello? Loki?

355
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,510
小心我的羽毛
Hey, hey. Watch the feathers.

356
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,630
-可惜我们不能给他妈打电话  -什么
- Too bad we can't call his mom. - What?

357
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,720
一般不都是这样吗
That's what always happens.

358
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,160
年轻人开派对  嗨过了头
Teenagers throw a party, it gets out of control...

359
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,250
你可真是个天才
Oh, you really are a genius.

360
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,610
现在看起来就是这样的  我刚才说什么了
It's really starting to look that way, isn't it? What'd I say?

361
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,090
如果有托尔和洛基
If there's a Thor and a Loki,

362
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:09,760
那肯定有奥丁  弗丽嘉和海姆达尔
then there must be an Odin and a Frigga and a Heimdall!

363
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,120
他和谁来着
Uh, he-man-who-now?

364
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,710
你看  我也有王冠  我们还都喜欢火
You know, I've got a crown too, and we both like fire, right?

365
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,650
来嘛  把你那火点上
Come on. Let's see you turn up the heat on this thing.

366
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,900
看看几点了
Uh... Ooh, look at the time.

367
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,480
我能弯多低呢
How low can I go?

368
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,070
各位  看我从那个尖东西上滑下去
Everyone! Watch me slide down that pointy thing.

369
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,570
咱们走
And away!

370
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,100
连上这个  绿色亮了  好  很好  就绪
This one goes here. Green in the thing. Okay, sweet. Good to go.

371
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,300
塞尔维格  谢谢你
Selvig, thank you.

372
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,350
重新排列卫星  放大信号强度
Re-aligning the satellites, magnifying the signal.

373
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,280
海姆达尔
Heimdall!

374
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,450
-没起作用  -好  好  到我了  我来
- It's not working. - Okay, okay. My turn. I got this.

375
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:24,000
那辆海军蓝色普锐斯的车主  能不能...
Would the owner of the navy blue Prius...

376
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,050
你好  所以  关于托尔...
Hi. So, uh, about Thor...

377
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,160
不怎么样  我可感觉到疼了
Not cool. I actually felt that one.

378
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,980
-我们已就位  -装备核弹
- We're in position. - Arm the nukes.

379
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,980
什么  我以为她才是那核弹
What? But I thought she was the nuke.

380
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,300
以防万一她被猫分神
Just in case she gets distracted by a cat.

381
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,490
...你好  奥丁夫人
Uh... Hello, Mrs. Odinwife?

382
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,520
那是霞多丽酒吗
Uh, is that Chardonnay?

383
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,550
算是变种  是的  有什么可以帮你
A varietal, yes. Can I help you?

384
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,100
你为什么坚持要破坏我的乐趣
Why do you insist on crushing my mellow?

385
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,620
放松  享受一下  稍微笑一笑
Huh? Loosen up. Have fun. Smile a little.

386
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,310
随时可以开火  长官
Ready to fire on your command.

387
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,100
开火倒计时  五...
Fire in five...

388
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,900
我警告过你了  我用拳头警告过你了
I gave you a warning. Hell, I gave you a warning punch.

389
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,600
-四  -是托尔  他有麻烦了
- Four. - It's Thor. He's in trouble.

390
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,430
-三  -他在地球
- Three. - He's on Earth.

391
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,970
二
Two.

392
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,850
-惊奇队长怎么办  -她不会有事的
- What about Captain Marvel? - She'll be fine.

393
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,780
一
One.

394
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,090
托尔  阿斯加德的王子
Thor, Crown Prince of Asgard,

395
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:50,610
奥丁的独生子  你在干什么
only son of Odin, what are you doing?

396
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,070
-母亲  -母亲
- Mother! - Mother?

397
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,020
母亲
Mother?

398
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,740
你怎么来了
What are you doing here?

399
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,560
为了关注我的行踪  你肯定用了不少黑暗魔法
You must be using a lot of dark magic just to check in on me.

400
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,370
有人来找我  她很担心你
Ugh, I had a visitor. She's worried about you.

401
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,790
什么...  简把我出卖了
Wha... Jane sold me out?

402
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,670
她说你在米德加德
She said you were on Midgard.

403
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,450
她弄错了
Well, she is mistaken.

404
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,320
我很显然在我房间里  学习
I'm obviously in my room, studying.

405
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,690
不要对你的母亲撒谎
Do not tell falsehoods to your mother.

406
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,760
你是说地球啊  抱歉  我理解错了
Oh, you mean Earth. Sorry, I misunderstood.

407
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,550
当地人管这里叫地球  是的  没错  对不起
The locals call it that. Yes, right. Sorry.

408
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,160
我一时之间没听懂
Confused there for a moment.

409
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:31,280
我和学习小组的伙伴们过来进行文化交流
Me and my study group came down here for a cultural exchange.

410
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,180
"文化交流"
"Cultural exchange."

411
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,930
你知道我们这种人  渴望知识的战士
You know us. We're warriors for knowledge.

412
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,640
真的吗  那我得亲自看看
Hmm. Really? Then this I have to see for myself.

413
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,150
我要提前结束行程
I'm cutting my trip short.

414
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,860
你要来这里
You're coming here?

415
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,370
我可爱的儿子  我希望
And, my sweet son, I expect

416
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,790
我到达的时候能看见你的全套学习计划
to see your full syllabus when I arrive.

417
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,030
机会难得  希尔
Now or never, Hill.

418
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:53,660
退下  我们结束了
Stand down. We're done here.

419
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:56,170
我们永远没有机会发射核弹了
We never get to fire the nukes.

420
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,240
我差点都要替你难过了  美人儿
I almost feel bad for you, Blondie.

421
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,250
求你了  你得帮帮我  我母亲要来了
Please, you must help me. My mother is coming.

422
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,950
想听我的建议吗  从角落开始往外清洁吧
My suggestion? Start in the corners, clean your way outward.

423
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,310
角落  角落
Corners, corners...

424
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,480
但这是个球体啊
But it's a sphere.

425
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,440
抱歉了  女士们  我得提前离开了  又一次
Ugh. Excuse me, ladies. I'm sorry, but I must leave early. Again.

426
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,230
洛基  我的弟弟  我需要你的帮助
Loki, my brother. I require your assistance.

427
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,390
我早就抢先一步了  小雷雷
Ah, one step ahead of you, Tiny Thunder.

428
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:25,650
我们哥几个打算在圣路易斯  圣...还是叫路易 
My bro's trying this thing in St. Louis. Saint... Is it "Louie"?

429
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,890
不管怎么说  我们打算
Anyway, we're about to make

430
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,760
制造宇宙里最大的弹弓
this universe's greatest slingshot.

431
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,060
好好享受你们在这里的时光吧
Try to enjoy the rest of your time here.

432
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,820
一千年以后见  海姆达尔
See you in another thousand years. Heimdall.

433
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,210
不玩弹弓了  不搞破坏了
No more slingshots. No more destruction.

434
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,140
我们得把这些清理一下回家去
We need to clean this mess up and go home.

435
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,040
马上
Ugh! Now!

436
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:48,090
干得漂亮  我差点信了
Ha! Nice one. Almost fell for it.

437
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,850
我没开玩笑  我母亲要来了
I'm not joking. My mother is coming.

438
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,990
但她不是我母亲
But she's not my mother.

439
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,550
我只是跟你情同兄弟而已  记得吗
You know, I'm your brother from another mother, remember?

440
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,830
来吧  冰人们  咱们走
Come on, Ice Bros, let's go.

441
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,780
等等  你不能走  看看这地方
Wait. You can't leave. Look at this place.

442
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,500
我们对这个地方有责任  你得把这些清理了
We have a duty to this planet. You need to clean it up.

443
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,400
"责任  清理"  你的语气和奥丁一样
"Duty, clean"? Ugh, you sound like Odin.

444
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,360
什么
What?

445
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,040
冰人们  咱们闪人
Ice Men, let's bounce.

446
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,170
好了  大家听着  派对结束了
All right, listen, party's over.

447
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,900
你们不一定非得回家  但是不能留在这里
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay.

448
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,080
等等  你去哪  回来
Wait, where you going? Come back.

449
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,090
不  不  不
No, no, no, no, no.

450
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,230
你们得留下  我们需要把这里清理干净
You do have to stay here, and we need to clean up.

451
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,840
看看现在是谁在扫兴了
Look who's pooping the party now.

452
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,710
是你  你在扫兴
It is you! You are pooping the party.

453
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,830
你们去哪  回来
Where you going? Come back!

454
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,270
走  托佩兹  我们乘风而去
Let's go, Topaz. We shall ride like the wind.

455
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,590
-拜托了  等等  -废物
- Please! Wait. - Loser.

456
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,450
而且我们把小车车也带走
And we're keeping the scoot-scoots.

457
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,920
各位  求你们了  帮帮忙  你  你怎么样
Guys, please. Help, I... You. How about you?

458
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,090
我听见我爸给我打电话了  祝你好运
Uh... I think I hear my dad calling. Good luck.

459
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,170
各位  拜托了  大家得留下帮忙啊
People. Beings. Please, everyone, you must stay and help.

460
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,240
众神之父  赐予我力量
Allfather, give me strength.

461
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,780
你们听我说
You will listen to me.

462
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,370
我的母亲要来了
My mother is coming.

463
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,890
-弗丽嘉  -她不开心
- Frigga? - And she is not happy.

464
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,660
非常不开心
Like, at all.

465
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,430
她非常生气
She's really mad.

466
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,440
行啊  宝贝
Yeah, baby.

467
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,860
{\an8}托尔最棒

468
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,460
{\an8}意大利

469
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,120
托尔
Thor.

470
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,270
你好  母亲  看见你很高兴  欢迎来到我的学习小组
Oh, hello, Mother. Good to see you. Welcome to our study group.

471
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,010
大家和我母亲打个招呼
Everyone say hello to Mother.

472
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,770
你好  弗丽嘉妈妈
Hello, Mother Frigga.

473
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,690
在我们学习结束前  我们通常会怎么说来着  同学们
And to end our studies, what do we always say, class?

474
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,770
学习是有魔力的
Learning is magic.

475
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,360
看  我都跟你说我是在做教育文化交流了
See? I told you I was on an educational and cultural exchange.

476
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,740
你知道米德加德是斯努吉的出生地吗
Did you know that Midgard is the birthplace of the Snuggie?

477
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,310
母亲  你不相信
Mother, you doubt?

478
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,540
看看我们学了多少东西
But look at all this learning, huh?

479
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,130
托尔  这里是你想要的
Thor, here's the information

480
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,930
关于人类文明的信息
you requested on human civilizations.

481
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:51,110
我还下载了一些纪录片  PBS特别节目  NPR的播客等等
And I loaded a few documentaries, PBS specials, NPR podcasts.

482
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,810
我下星期给你打电话讨论
I'll call you next week to discuss it.

483
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:58,350
这么小但是里面装了这么这么多  谢谢
So tiny yet contains so, so much. Thank you.

484
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,580
你一定是弗丽嘉  我是惊奇队长
You must be Frigga. I'm Captain Marvel.

485
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:05,300
我知道你是谁  谢谢你帮助教育我的儿子
I know who you are. Thank you for helping educate my son.

486
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,150
-走吧  亲爱的  -等等
- Let's go, darling. - Wait.

487
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,330
差点忘了
Almost forgot.

488
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,700
母亲  我可以解释
Mother, I can explain.

489
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,870
谢谢
Thanks.

490
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,590
你找我母亲告状
You called my mother on me.

491
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,230
这么做可一点不酷
That wasn't a cool thing to do,

492
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:33,440
但是这么做是正确的  所以  谢谢
but it was the right thing. So, thank you.

493
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,010
不客气
You're welcome.

494
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,550
我会给你打电话  酷吗
I'll call you? Cools?

495
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,540
不  这不叫  "酷吗"
No, it is not "Cools."

496
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,400
不
No?

497
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,550
我还以为我们之间有点什么  我真的很喜欢你  简
But I thought we had something. I really like you, Jane.

498
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,610
不仅仅因为你是个天才
And not just because you're a genius.

499
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:48,550
你还非常有魅力而且...
You're also very attractive and...

500
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,430
那就约我出去啊
Well, then, ask me out on a date.

501
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,600
简·福斯特  我很荣幸能够约你出去
Jane Foster, it would be my honor to take you on a date.

502
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,360
在你回答之前  我想说
Before you answer, let me say

503
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,880
我知道一个地方全是独角兽
that I know a whole planet full of unicorns.

504
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,620
连侍者都是独角兽...
Even the waiters are unicorns...

505
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,530
-非常完美  -听起来不错  八点钟来接我
- It's wonderful. - Sounds delightful. Pick me up at0800?

506
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,850
一个世界是秩序恢复了  爱情萌发
A world restored, love blossoming.

507
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,510
正如人类和阿斯加德的儿童所说的那样
As children, both human and Asgardian, say,

508
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:28,180
他们一起幸福地生活下去直到永远
together, they lived happily ever after.

509
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,880
等等  什么
Wait, what?

510
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:39,980
亲爱的  也许我话说得太早了
Oh, dear. Perhaps I spoke too soon.
